> Pown.js is the security testing an exploitation framework built on top of Node.js and npm.

This repo includes the Pown official distribution plus some modules **under development** which are still not present on it.

:fire: You should consider this project **experimental**, so use the official one in production environments: https://github.com/pownjs/pown.


## Quickstart

```sh
# Install Pown.js globally:
npm install -g pown-next

# Run a module.
pown-next geo
```
